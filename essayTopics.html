					<li data-theme="b">Originally Jane Austen had planned to title the novel First Impressions, how would this have been a suitable title?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">title fits the novel perfectly just as the final title.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">First impressions play a major role, and in Darcy and Elizabeth's cases they must overcome his first impressions of Elizabeth in order for there relationship to succeed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Initially Darcy sees Elizabeth as not attractive enough and too homely and dismisses her, he also initially has a class based prejudice towards her as she is not wealthy enough and lacks the family connections that he believes his future wife should have.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Elizabeth on the other hand first sees Darcy as an arrogant and snobbish man, which allows her to easily believe untrue slanderous accusations about Darcy.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two must overcome these first impressions in order to realize their true love for one another.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Darcy manages to put aside his prejudice, and Elizabeth comes to see Darcy's true character, and the relationship blossoms.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Does Mr. Bennet play a positive or negative role in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Austen portrays Mr. Bennet as an extremely witty and interesting man.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He is an endearing character due to his wit, as well as detachment from the some of the other more ridiculous characters such as Mr. Collins or Lady Catherine.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Despite his amusing nature and likability he lacks important qualities and doesn't prove to be a very good husband or father.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This is further proved when the controversy between Lydia's elopement occurs, Mr. Bennet is unable to handle the situation and instead it is left up to others.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This experience goes to show that despite being a witty and dynamic character, he lacks the important qualities that would make him a positive and respected character.</li>
